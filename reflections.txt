2. Describe the 2 features you added to the project.
  a) App Welcome: Allows a user to interact with application form the command line.
  b) App Add_list: Allows a user to add an app from the command_line interface.

# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
  4 Hours
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
  Getting terminal to work was pretty cool. Actually getting to pull in
  a gem, go to the docs, and get it to it work was pretty satisfying.
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
  The changes I made were to the app an interface and create functionality for the
  interface.
  The first thing I did was add an interface for the app. It's basically a loop
  that allows the user to input a number of different options to perform different
  tasks until they decided to exit the program.
  The second thing I did was implement a couple of simple functions into the app.
  The first function that I added was the ability to print out the name of all of
  the lists. The second function that I added was the ability for a user to create
  a new list from the command line. This open up the possibility of future
  functionality such as adding items to a list, modifying a list, etc.
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
  I still want to spend more time learning how to develop scalable apps.
